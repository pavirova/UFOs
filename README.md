# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to create a website on UFO sightings in the United States using our newly acquired knowledge of JavaScript coding and connecting our JavaScript code to an html file. In this project, we edited the HTML file with Bootstrap and added filtering functions on our *app.js* file that helped create a dynamic table that showcases all of the UFO sightings data, and filters the table depending on inputs the user writes on the date, city, state, country, and shape input boxes.

## Results:

The image above shows the "Filter Search" area of the website, where users can filter the information on the table based on a number of criteria, including date, city, state, country, and shape seen by whoever reported the UFO encounter. As can be seen from the image, each of the fields contains a placeholder for the type of data that can be entered into each input box. There are lots of data in the initial table, so if users want to look at data for UFO encounters that happened in a specific city, for example, California, they can enter "ca" under city along with any other specific filters they want, and when pressing enter, the table's data will filter to include only data specified by the user's input.

## Summary: 
One drawback of this website is that although it looks nice, clean, and professoinal, it still looks a bit empty, particularly above the filter search area. Some recommendations for further development could be to add a section above the filter search area that showcases articles regarding UFO encounters from one or multiple reliable sources and updates automatically anytime there is a new article, that way users can be kept up do date with the latest information on UFO sightings. Another recommendation to improve the website would be to add an image of a UFO so that the website is more aesthetiscally pleasing.
